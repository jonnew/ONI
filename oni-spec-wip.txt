    This document specifies requirements for implementing an Open Neuro
    Interface (ONI) acquisition system in hardware and software. This
    specification entails two basic elements: (1) Communication protocols
    between acquisition firmware and host software and (2) an application
    programming interface (API) for utilizing this communication protocol. This
    document is incomplete and we gratefully welcome criticisms and amendments.

# FPGA/Host PC communication {#comm-protocol}
Communication between the acquisition board firmware and API shall occur
over at least four communication channels:

1. Signal: Read-only, short-message, asynchronous hardware events. Only one
   signal channel is permitted.
2. Configuration: Bidirectional, register-based, synchronous configuration
   setting and getting. Only one configuration channel is permitted.
3. Input: Read-only, asynchronous, high-bandwidth firmware to host streaming.
   More than one input channel is permitted.
4. Output: Write-only, asynchronous, high-bandwidth host to firmware streaming.
   More than one output channel is permitted.

Required characteristics of these channels are described in the following
paragraphs.

## Signal channel  {#sig-chan}

- __Word size__ : 8 bits
- __R/W Timing__ : Asynchronous
- __Read Only__

The _signal_ channel provides a way for the FPGA firmware to inform host of
configuration results, which may be provided with a significant delay.
Additionally, it allows the host to read the device map supported by the FPGA
firmware. The behavior of the signal channel is equivalent to a read-only,
blocking UNIX named pipe. Signal data is framed into packets using Consistent
Overhead Byte Stuffing
([COBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing)).
Within this scheme, packets are delimited using 0's and always have the
following format:

```
... | PACKET_FLAG data | ...
```

where `PACKET_FLAG` is 32-bit unsigned integer with a single unique bit
setting, ` | ` represents a packet delimiter, and `...` represents other
packets. This stream can be read and ignored  until a desired packet is
received. Reading this stream shall block if no data is available, which allows
asynchronous configuration acknowledgment. Valid `PACKET_FLAG`s are:

``` {.c}
enum signal {
    NULLSIG      = (1u << 0), // Null signal, ignored by host
    CONFIGWACK   = (1u << 1), // Configuration write-acknowledgment
    CONFIGWNACK  = (1u << 2), // Configuration no-write-acknowledgment
    CONFIGRACK   = (1u << 3), // Configuration read-acknowledgment
    CONFIGRNACK  = (1u << 4), // Configuration no-read-acknowledgment
    DEVICEMAPACK = (1u << 5), // Device map start acknowledgment
    DEVICEINST   = (1u << 6), // Device map instance
};
```

Following a hardware reset, the signal channel is used to provide the device
map to the host using the following packet sequence:

```
... | DEVICEMAPACK, uint32_t num_devices | DEVICEINST device dev_0
    | DEVICEINST device dev_1 | ... | DEVICEINST device dev_n | ...
```

Following a device register read or write (see [configuration
channel](#conf-chan)), ACK or NACK signals are pushed onto the signal stream by
the firmware. For instance, on a successful register read:

```
... | CONFIGRACK, uint32_t register value | ...
```

## Configuration channel {#conf-chan}

- __Word size__ : 32 bits
- __R/W Timing__ : Synchronous
- __Read & Write__

The _configuration_ channel supports seeking to, reading, and writing a set of
configuration registers. Its behavior is equivalent to that of a normal UNIX
file. There are two classes of registers handled by the configuration channel:
the first set of registers encapsulates a generic device register programming
interface. The remaining registers are for global context control and
configuration and provide access to acquisition parameters and state control.
`SEEK` locations of each configuration register, relative to the start of the
stream, should be hard-coded into the API implementation file and used in the
background to manipulate register state.

### Device register programming interface
The device programming interface is composed of the following configuration
channel registers:

- `uint32_t config_device_idx`: Device index register. Specify a device
  endpoint as enumerated in the device map by the firmware (e.g. an Intan chip,
  or a IMU chip) and to which communication will be directed using
  `config_reg_addr` and `config_reg_value`, as described below.

- `uint32_t config_reg_addr`: The register address of configuration to be
  written

- `uint32_t config_reg_value`: configuration value to be written to or read
  from and that corresponds to `config_reg_addr` on device `config_device_id`

- `uint32_t config_rw`: A flag indicating if a read or write should be
  performed.  0 indicates read operation. A value > 0 indicates write
  operation.

- `uint32_t config_trig`: Set > 0 to trigger either register read or write
  operation depending on the state of `config_rw`. If `config_rw` is 0, a read
  is performed. In this case `config_reg_value` is updated with value stored at
  `config_reg_addr` on device at `config_device_id`. If `config_rw` is 1,
  `config_reg_value` is written to register at `config_reg_addr` on device
  `config_device_id`. The `config_trig` register is always be set low by the
  firmware following transmission even if it is not successful or does not make
  sense given the address register values.

Appropriate values of `config_reg_addr` and `config_reg_value` are
determined by:

- Looking at a device's data sheet if the device is an integrated circuit
- Examining the ONI-compliant API's documentation which contains off register
  addresses and descriptions for devices officially supported by this project.

When a host requests a device register _read_, the following following actions
take place:

1. The value of `config_trig` is checked.
    - If it is 0, the function call proceeds.
    - Else, the function call returns with an error specifying a retrigger.
1. `dev_idx` is copied to the `config_device_idx` register on the host FPGA.
1. `addr` is copied to the `config_reg_addr` register on the host FPGA.
1. The `config_rw` register on the host FPGA is set to 0x00.
1. The `config_trig` register on the host FPGA is set to 0x01,
triggering configuration transmission by the firmware.
1. (Firmware) A configuration read is performed by the firmware.
1. (Firmware) `config_trig` is set to 0x00 by the firmware.
1. (Firmware) `CONFIGRACK` is pushed onto the signal stream by the
firmware.
1. The signal stream is pumped until either `CONFIGRACK` or `CONFIGRNACK` is
   received indicating that the host FPGA has either:
    - Completed reading the specified device register and copied its value to
      the `config_reg_value` register.
    - Failed to read the register in which case the value of `config_reg_value`
      contains invalid data.

When a host requests a device register _write_, the following following actions
take place:

1. The value of `config_trig` is checked.
    - If it is 0, the function call proceeds.
    - Else, the function call returns with an error specifying a retrigger.
1. `dev_idx` is copied to the `config_device_id` register on the host FPGA.
1. `addr` is copied to the `config_reg_addr` register on the host FPGA.
1. `value` is copied to the `config_reg_value` register on the host FPGA.
1. The `config_rw` register on the host FPGA is set to 0x01.
1. The `config_trig` register on the host FPGA is set to 0x01, triggering
configuration transmission by the firmware.
1. (Firmware) A configuration write is performed by the firmware.
1. (Firmware) `config_trig` is set to 0x00 by the firmware.
1. (Firmware) `CONFIGWACK` is pushed onto the signal stream by the
firmware.
1. The signal stream is pumped until either `CONFIGWACK` or `CONFIGWNACK` is
   received indicating that the host FPGA has either:
    - Successfully completed writing the specified device register
    - Failed to write the register

Following successful or unsuccessful device register read or write, the
appropriate ACK or NACK packets _must_ be passed to the [signal
channel](#sig-chan). If they are not, the register read and write calls will
block indefinitely.

### Global acquisition registers
The following global acquisition registers provide information about, and
control over, the entire acquisition system:

- `uint32_t running`: set to > 0 to run the system clock and produce data. Set
  to 0 to stop the system clock and therefore stop data flow. Results in no
  other configuration changes.

- `uint32_t reset`: set to > 0 to trigger a hardware reset and send a fresh
  device map to the host and reset hardware to its default state. Set to 0 by
  host firmware upon entering the reset state.

- `uint32_t sys_clock_hz`: A read-only register specifying the master (clock
  domain 0) hardware clock frequency in Hz. The clock counter in the read
  [frame](#frame) header is incremented at this frequency.

## Data read channel {#data-rd-chan}

- __Word size__ : 32 bits
- __R/W Timing__ : Asynchronous
- __Read Only__

The _data read_ channel provides high bandwidth communication from the FPGA
firmware to the host computer using direct memory access (DMA). From the host's
perspective, its behavior is equivalent to a read-only, blocking UNIX named
pipe with the exception that data can only be read on 32-bit, instead of 8-bit,
boundaries. The data input channel communicates with the host using
[frames](#frame) with a read-header ("read-frames"). Read-frames are pushed
into the data input channel at a rate dictated by the FPGA firmware. It is
incumbent on the host to read this stream fast enough to prevent buffer
overflow. At the time of this writing, a typical implementation will allocate
an input buffer that occupies a 512 MB segment of kernal RAM. Increased
bandwidth demands will necessitate the creation of a user-space buffer. This
change shall have no effect on the API.

## Data write channel {#data-wr-chan}

- __Word size__ : 32 bits
- __R/W Timing__ : Asynchronous
- __Write Only__

The _data write_ channel provides high bandwidth communication from the host
computer to the FPGA firmware using DMA via calls. From the host's perspective,
its behavior is equivalent to a write-only, blocking UNIX named pipe with the
exception that data can only be written on 32-bit, instead of 8-bit,
boundaries. Its performance characteristics are largely identical to the data
input channel. However, the format of data  written to the this channel is
different. Instead of writing frames with header information describing the
frame contents, data should be written to a single device at a time. This
action is very similar to a UNIX `write` syscall with some additional
arguments: namely the file descriptor is replaced by a context and device
index:

```
// UNIX write
size_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);

// Possible ONI write
size_t oni_write(const oni_ctx ctx, size_t dev_idx, const void *data, size_t data_sz)
```

# Required API Types and Behavior {#api-spec}
In the following sections we define required API datatypes and how they are
used by the API to communicate with hardware. An implementation of this API,
[liboepcie](#api-imp), follows.

## Context
A _context_ shall hold all state required to manage single [FPGA/Host
communication system](#comm-protocol). This includes a device map (simple list
of _devices_) being acquired from, data buffering elements, etc. API calls will
typically take a context handle as the first argument and use it to reference
required state information to enable communication and/or to mutate the context
to reflect some function side effect (e.g. add device map information):

```
int api_function(context *ctx, ...);
```

## Device
A _device_ is defined as configurable piece of hardware with its own register
address space (e.g. an integrated circuit) or something programmed within the
firmware to emulate this (e.g. an electrical stimulation sub-circuit made to
behave like a Master-8). Host interaction with a device is facilitated using a
device description, which holds the following elements:

- `device_id`: Device ID number
- `slot`: The index of the physical interface that this device uses for host
  communication
- `clock_dom`: Device clock domain (0 is master, 1 or greater are slaves
  synchronized to master)
- `clock_hz`: Clock rate in Hz of clock governing `clock_dom`
- `read_active`: Device will use the data input channel if read_size > 0 and it
  has valid data.
- `read_size`: Device data read size per frame in bytes
- `num_reads`: Number of frames that must be read to construct a full
  sample (e.g., for row reads from camera)
- `write_size`: Device data write size per frame in bytes
- `num_writes`: Number of frames that must be written to construct a full
  output sample (e.g., for row writes for a display)

An array of structures holding each of these entries forms a _device map_. A
_context_ is responsible for managing a single device map, which keep track of
where to send and receive streaming data and configuration information during
API calls. A detailed description of each of each value comprising a device
instance is as follows:

1. `device_id` [RO]: Device identification number which is globally
   enumerated for the entire project
    - There shall be a single enumeration for a ONI library implementation that
      uniquely identifies all possible devices that are controlled across _context_
      configurations.  This enumeration will grow with the number of devices
      supported by the library.
    - e.g. A host board GPIO subcircuit is could be 0, Intan RHD2132 is 1, Intan
      RHD2164 is 2, etc.

2. `slot` [RO]: The index of the physical interface that this device uses for host
   communication
    - e.g. the PCIe slot index
    - e.g. the USB port index
    - Typically, host hardware will be assigned an index in non-volatile memory
      or via dip switch configuration.

2. `clock_dom` [RO]: The clock domain that the device is sychronized to.
    - All devices exist in a single clock domain
    - There are one or more clock domains per device_map

3. `clock_hz` [RO]: The clock rate in Hz of the clock governing `clock_dom`

4. `read_active` [RW]: If not 0, the Device will use the data input channel if read_size > 0 and it
  has valid data.
    - This value can be changed  to prevent the device from using data
      input channel resources
    - It is a device-specific data gate that is independent of `read_size` and
      `num_reads`

4. `read_size` [RO]: Number of bytes of data transmitted by this device during a
    single read.
    - 0 indicates that it does not send data.

5. `num_reads` [RO]: Number of reads required to construct a full device read sample
   (e.g., number of columns when `read_size` corresponds to a single row of
   pixels from a camera sensor)

6. `write_size` [RO]: Number of bytes accepted by the device during a single write
    - 0 indicates that it does not send data.

7. `num_writes` [RO]: Number of writes required to construct a full device output
   sample.

## Frame
A _frame_ is a flat byte array containing a single sample's worth of data for a
set (one to all) of devices within a device map. Data within frames is arranged
into three memory sectors as follows:

```
[32 byte header,                              // 1. Header
 dev_0 idx, dev_1 idx, ... , dev_n idx,       // 2. Device map indices
 dev_0 data, dev_1 data, ... , dev_n data]    // 3. Data

```
Each frame memory sector is described below:

1. Header
    - Each frame starts with a 32-byte header
    - For reading (firmware to host) operations, the header contains
        - bytes 0-7: unsigned 64-bit integer holding system clock counter
        - bytes 8-9: unsigned 16-bit integer indicating number of devices that
          the frame contains data for
        - byte 10: 8-bit integer specifying fame error state. frame error. 0 =
          OK. 1 = data may be corrupt.
        - bytes 11-32: reserved

    - For writing (host to firmware) operations , the header contains
        - bytes 0-32: reserved

2. Device map indices
    - An array of unsigned 32-bit keys corresponding the device map captured by
      the host during _context_ initialization
    - The offset, size, and type information of the _i_th data block within the
      `data` section of each frame is determined by examining the _i_th member
      of the device map.

3. Data
    - Raw data blocks from each device in the device map.
    - The ordering of device-specific blocks is the same as the device index
      within the _device map index_ portion of the frame
    - The read/write size for each device-specific block is provided in the
      device map
    - If timing informaiton is passed in the data block, it should be specified
      how to interpret it (using plain text).

# Notes for version 0.4

1. Support for multiple data input and output channels
    - The input or output channel used by a device should be part of its descriptor
    - The `slot` member was added for this, but its functionality needs to be tested
2. Add device silencing to _context_ options
    - User should be able to shut off particular devices to prevent them from
      using the input channel
    - This can be accomplished via very similar logic to RUNNING -- it will
      interact wwith the data input controller at the same points, but in a
      device-specific manner.
3. Add a read-only global register with hardware revision version and firmware
version. Or, when we get reconfiguration working, static firmware version and
loaded firmware version. This is especially important for reconfiguration, as
we might need different bitfiles for different versions in the future. In any
case having information and a way of knowing which board is being used never
hurts.
4. The whole concept of "official" device IDs might be beyond the intended
scope of this spec. Instead, maybe devices should only berequired to report
frame read/write sizes in device map. Having official IDs can be an
implementation choice. I've moved the wording I'm referring to to here:

- Device IDs up to 9999 are reserved. Device ID 10000 and greater are free
  to use for custom hardware projects.
- The use of device IDs less than 10000 not specified within this
  enumeration will result in OE_EDEVID errors.
- Device numbers greater than 9999 are allowed for general purpose use and
  will not be verified by the API.
- Incorporation into the official device enum (device IDs < 10000) can be
  achieved via pull-request to the ONI repository.
